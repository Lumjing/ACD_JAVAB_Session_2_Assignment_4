# ACD_JAVAB_Session_2_Assignment_4
This assignment tested my skills on Control Structures/Loops and Conditional statements .  Objective : This assignment will help you to master the following concepts -> Loops, Conditional statements AND Operators  Problem Statement : • Write a program TestDemo.java, which accepts the number as argument and print “You Have Entered Zero” if the value is equal to 0 along with the ASCII value of the number. It should print “You Have Entered Positive Value” if the value is greater than 0 along with the ASCII value. It should print “You Have Entered Negative Value” if the value is less than 0 along with the ASCII value. • A student has A grade if marks are more than 70, B grade if marks are between 61 and 70 and C grade if marks are less than 61 ) Write a program to print the grade for the given marks. • Take three subjects like PCM and calculate the average and the above grading system will work on the average. • Take marks of the subject from the user.  I have uploaded the screenshot of console output which is exactly same as asked one. I have taken care of proper commenting and camelCase declaration style.
